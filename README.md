# 🐶 Stanford Dogs Dataset – Image Classification with CNN, ViT, and Mamba

## 📊 Dataset

The **Stanford Dogs Dataset** consists of 20,580 images across 120 dog breeds.  
The dataset is loaded from the official folder structure and split into training and validation using `ImageDataGenerator`.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Perform dog breed classification using different vision models:
  - ✅ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  - ✅ Vision Transformer (ViT)
  - ✅ Vision Mamba (Efficient sequence model)
- Visualize and analyze how each model learns and represents the dataset
- Compare performance using:
  - Validation accuracy/loss
  - Feature space clustering via PCA/t-SNE
